## ✨ What is this?

The B.R.I.D.G.E. Link Page is a digital hub that connects all facets of the **B.R.I.D.G.E. ecosystem**—a grassroots network focused on economic survival, misinformation resistance, and collective liberation.

> "The product is liberation. The service is empowerment. The message is undeniable."

This portal brings together:
- The **Economic Survival Manual**  
- The **B.R.I.D.G.E. Files** Substack  
- The **Reframe Store**  
- Social and organizing tools  
- Future links for events, downloads, and project offshoots

It serves as both a **navigation point** and a **signal transmission**—a space to organize, educate, and activate.

## 🛠️ How I Built It

- **Tech Stack:**  
  - HTML + CSS + JavaScript 
  - Hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)  
  - Glitch used for design previews + visual experimentation  
  - Custom fonts and visual assets designed to reflect the Afrofuturist + poetic identity of the movement

- **Design Goals:**  
  - Clean, fast-loading, and responsive  
  - Creative coding style that balances minimalism with cosmic symbolism  
  - Color palette based on the “Modern Resistance” guide (Midnight Navy, Electric Teal, Pale Sand, Magenta)

- **Fonts & Assets:**  
  - Primary typefaces: `Bebas Neue`, `Inter`, and `JetBrains Mono`  
  - Logo created with assistance from generative design tools + post-processing  
  - SVG glyphs and celestial symbols are gradually being added for storytelling

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add animation and glitch effects for subtle signal transmission vibe  
- Integrate real-time updates via Substack feed or webhook
